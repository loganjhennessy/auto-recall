# Auto Recall

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/loganjhennessy/auto-recall.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/loganjhennessy/auto-recall)

An auto-associative note-taking application.

Motivation
I have a shitty memory. I can solve problems. I can "figure it out" (whatever "it" is). And I can Google like a teenager looking up STD symptoms. But when it comes to people, places, dates, and... the name of that guy who was in that one show we really like, you know, the one with the funny laugh, what show was that? You get the idea. Yeah, when it comes to hard facts, I can't remember shit.

Now I'm lucky because my job generally revolves around solving problems. When solving problems, I'm allowed to use the higher-order functions of my mind to draw analogy between abstract patterns in order to make decisions about complex situations that will result in the optimal result for all interested paries. Wow, I'm pretty smart, right? Yeah, not when I'm trying to communicate said decision to said interested parties and suddenly can't remember seemingly basic names and numbers (I would provide a more specific example... if I could remember one).

Professional embarassment aside, who doesn't want to have a better memory? And in today's day-and-age of technological glory, why isn't there something better out there to help?

Now, sure, there are countless self-help books and courses on memory- enhancement techniques which boast "incredible results or your money back!" But who has time for that? So much better to spend countless hours and sleepless nights coding up an app that may or may not help than to spend one second reading a boring book or listening to an audio program that will "change your life."

So here I am, with the audacious goal of creating a memory-augmentation- tool that will, at the very least, make it seem like I have a great memory.
